*** You will need to insert the following lines in your Machine Settings Start g-code section ***

; Klipper START_PRINT macro parameters.
;   If not listed they will default to firmware values.
;   If listed and no value given, then the values will be null/empty which may cause problems
; Z_OFFSET_ADJ - more negative the number moves the nozzle closer to the bed, tweaks existing Z offset in firmware
; EXTRUDER_STEP_DISTANCE - replaces firmware extrusion rate value, higher values = less flow 
;                         find your current value by checking the console monitor after running a print, you should see the value you're currently using
; PRESSURE_ADVANCE - PA setting here overrides value defined in firmware
; PRESSURE_ADVANCE_SMOOTH_TIME - setting here overrides value defined in firmware
; BED_MESH_PROFILE_NAME - Name of bed mesh profile to be loaded after homing is completed, not needed if your bed mesh is named "default"

;IF YOU USE RELATIVE EXTRUSION IN SUPERSLICER, YOU MUST ADD AN M83 BELOW THE START_PRINT MACRO CALL.
;   OTHERWISE YOUR GCODE WILL HAVE RELATIVE E-LENGTHS BUT THE PRINT WILL USE THEM AS ABSOLUTE.
;   LEADING TO THE PRINTER BOUNCING THE EXTRUDER BACK AND FORTH AND NOT REALLY DOING ANY EXTRUSION.
;IF YOU DO NOT USE RELATIVE EXTRUSION IN SUPERSLICER, THEN NOTHING OTHER THAN THE START_PRINT MACRO CALL IS NEEDED.
